# Example of Arthmetic Operators

# Taking two number input from the user
a = int(input("Enter First Number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second Number: "))

print(a + b)    # Addition Operator
print(a - b)    # Subtraction  Operator
print(a * b)    # Multiplication Operator
print(a / b)    # Division Operator
print(a // b)   # Floor Division Operator
print(a % b)    # Modulus Operator
print(a ** b)   # Exponential Operator
